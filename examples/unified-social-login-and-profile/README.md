# Unified Social Login and Profile example

This is a simple example that shows how you can easily access different social network services using the [CloudRail Unified Social Profile API](https://cloudrail.com/integrations/interfaces/Profile;platformId=Nodejs).

You run the program by executing it with the desired network's name as command line argument, for example:

```
node index.js facebook
```

The program will then redirect the user to a browser where they have to login. Afterwards, the program will display the user's information, including their unique identifier which can be used for social logins.

## Prerequisites

You need to have node.js installed ([get it from here](http://nodejs.org/)) and need to have developer credentials for the services you want to use. Instructions on how they can be acquired can be found on our [Unified Social Profile API site](https://cloudrail.com/integrations/interfaces/Profile;platformId=Nodejs;serviceIds=Facebook%2CGitHub%2CGooglePlus%2CHeroku%2CInstagram%2CLinkedIn%2CProductHunt%2CSlack%2CTwitter%2CMicrosoftLive%2CYahoo). You also need a CloudRail API key that you can [get fro free here](https://cloudrail.com/signup).

Install the cloudrail-si node.js SDK by navigating to the project folder in a terminal and executing the command

```
npm install --save cloudrail-si
```

Find the following piece of code in your *index.js* file, and enter your developer credentials. Optionally, change the used port.


```javascript
cloudrail.Settings.setKey("[Your CloudRail Key]");

const port = 8082; // or any other free port on the local machine
```



```javascript

    service = new cloudrail.services.Facebook(
      cloudrail.RedirectReceivers.getLocalAuthenticator(8082),
